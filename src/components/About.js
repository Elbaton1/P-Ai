            <p>
                This website was made by Michael O'Brien and Adam Sparkes for our final project. We created it to help people find and understand patents more easily using AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site helps users search for patents, read summaries, and get useful insightsâ€”all in one place. We wanted to make the process simple and easy to use.
